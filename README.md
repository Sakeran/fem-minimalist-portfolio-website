## Notes

(November 22nd, 2021)

This project was interesting in a few ways. Compared to most of the Frontend Mentor challenges I've worked through, this portfolio site felt a lot more grounded than the demo apps and components I've been building up until now. The design, while presented as "minimalist", turned out to be somewhat complex to implement in a few areas, often requiring me to add a non-standard layout, or tweak some of the given assets in places. As a result, the project felt more like a collaboration with the designer than a development challenge, which was a nice change of pace.

As an aside, the project -also- put the importance of consistent naming conventions on display. It's a very image-heavy design, with lots of responsive variants, and I would have easily logged another hour into this project if I'd needed to manually configure every `picture` element for more heterogenous file names. I have no real insights here - I'm just grateful.

This also marked my first non-trivial application of TailwindCSS to a project. I enjoyed working with Tailwind for simple projects, but I was a little apprehensive about using it for something larger, like I did here. Now that I've finished, I think those fears were mostly unfounded. *Mostly*. I've found that while Tailwind provides a really nice, streamlined development experience 95% of the time, there is an unavoidable 5% where you need to do something custom (like pseudo-elements or complicated grid layouts), and *that* experience is nails-on-chalkboard maddening. With that said, I like the 95% experience enough to keep on working with the framework, and it might be possible to alleviate the pain of edge cases with better project structure.
